# -Alzheimer-s-Disease-Risk-Prediction
Machine Learning | Clinical UI 

A clinical decision-support web app that predicts the risk of Alzheimer’s disease using machine learning (XGBoost).This tool is created for educational and research purposes and does not replace professional medical diagnosis.

This project is an end-to-end Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction System built using XGBoost, Python, and Streamlit.
It analyzes medical, cognitive, behavioral, and lifestyle features to estimate the probability of Alzheimer’s disease and provides a clean, clinical-styled web UI.

The model uses 23 clinically relevant features impact on prediction.

⭐ Features
- Machine Learning
- XGBoost classification model
- StandardScaler preprocessing
- 23 selected medical & behavioral features
- Manual and real-time prediction support

✔ Interactive Web App (Streamlit)
- Fully responsive clinical-style UI
- Multi-section layout (Overview, Model Info, Prediction, Report)
- Sliders, dropdowns, and Yes/No inputs for clarity
- Instant prediction with risk score
- Clean visualization and structured results

📊 Machine Learning Workflow
- Data Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
- Feature Selection
- XGBoost Model Training
- Model Optimization
- Saving Model Artifacts (.pkl files)
- Streamlit App Integration

⚠️ Disclaimer

- This tool is not a medical diagnostic system.
- It is designed only for educational and research purposes.
- Always consult a qualified medical professional for diagnosis and treatment.
